# solar-irradiance
This dataset contains solar irradiance data collected from various sources. Solar irradiance is a measure of the power per unit area received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This dataset can be used for various research and practical applications in fields such as renewable energy, climate science, and atmospheric studies.

Contents
The dataset includes the following columns:

Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.
Location: Geographic location of the measurement (latitude and longitude).
GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance (W/m²) - total solar radiation received per unit area.
DNI: Direct Normal Irradiance (W/m²) - solar radiation received per unit area on a surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays.
DHI: Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (W/m²) - solar radiation received per unit area from the sky, excluding direct sunlight.
Temperature: Ambient temperature at the location (°C).
Humidity: Relative humidity at the location (%).
Wind_Speed: Wind speed at the location (m/s).
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure at the location (hPa).
Data Sources
The data is compiled from various reliable sources, including meteorological stations, satellite observations, and public datasets from institutions such as NASA, NOAA, and local weather stations.
